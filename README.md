This script will take two wordlist files as arguments and output their cartesian product. 
I found the need to make this script while studying Pentesting. It is useful to create custom wordlists for password cracking.

The size of the output will always be the number of lines of the first file times the number of lines of the second, so the user must be careful not to generate extremely huge files or to crash their machine.

Example use case:

```bash
root@kali:~/Documents# cat file1
ACE
2
3
4
5
6
7
8
9
10
J
Q
K
root@kali:~/Documents# cat file2
SPADES
DIAMONDS
HEARTS
CLUBS
root@kali:~/Documents# ./mergeWordlists.sh file1 file2
